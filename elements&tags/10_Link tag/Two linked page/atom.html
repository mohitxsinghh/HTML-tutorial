    <h2>The Struture of an Atom</h2>

    <p><a href="thomson.html">J.J. Thomson</a> was the first person to propose a model for the structure of an atom. He proposed that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An atom consists of a positively charged sphere and the electrons are embedded in it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The negative and positive charges are equal in magnitude.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So, the atom as a whole is electrically neutral.</p>
